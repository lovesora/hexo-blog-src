## Concepts and Terminology

- Workspace
- Repositories
- Packages
- Targets
	- files
		- source files
		- generated files
	- rules
- Labels
	- labels belones to only the first parent package(otherwise, it will throw a error "crosses a package boundary"

## Rules

### Phases
> It will be important to understand the three phases of a build (loading, analysis and execution)

### Attributes
> -   _Dependency attributes_, such as  `attr.label`  and  `attr.label_list`, declare a dependency from the target that owns the attribute to the target whose label appears in the attributeâ€™s value. This kind of attribute forms the basis of the target graph.

> _Output attributes_, such as `attr.output` and `attr.output_list`, declare an output file that the target generates.

> Both dependency attributes and output attributes take in label values.

#### Private Attribute
> Sometimes we want to not only provide a default value, but prevent the user from overriding this default. To do this, you can make the attribute _private_ by giving it a name that begins with an underscore (`_`). Private attributes must have default values. It generally only makes sense to use private attributes for implicit dependencies.
