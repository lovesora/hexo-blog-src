## Concepts and Terminology

- Workspace

		- source files
		- generated files
	- rules
- Labels
	- labels belones to only the first parent package(otherwise, it will throw a error "crosses a package boundary"

## Rules

### Phases
> It will be important to understand the three phases of a build (loading, analysis and execution)

### Attributes
> -   _Dependency attributes_, such as  `attr.label`  and  `attr.label_list`, declare a dependency from the target that owns the attribute to the target whose label appears in the attributeâ€™s value. This kind of attribute forms the basis of the target graph.

> _Output attributes_, such as `attr.output` and `attr.output_list`, declare an output file that the target generates.

> Both dependency attributes and output attributes take in label values.
